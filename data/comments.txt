COMMENT### Yet he will still have as much legal authority and, being term limited, little incentive to care about his non-majority status.

COMMENT### Term limited, lol. We'll see how long that lasts.

COMMENT### He’s life limited if that helps. He is not particularly healthy, even for someone his age. 

COMMENT### Trump is going to live to be 109 because there is no justice in this world. I have zero faith in anything.

COMMENT### You and I would be friends. : )

COMMENT### Sounds like you have faith in injustice/bad outcomes?

COMMENT### That's basically what pessimism is.

COMMENT### That should not make anyone feel better. Right now his incompetence is the last speed bump, when he dies or is 25th’d there will be more competent fascists in the role.

COMMENT### I'm hoping that his "power" lies with the cult, and his underlings aren't able to rouse the adoration that Trump somehow has. I think there's a good chance it all falls apart once he's no longer the figurehead.

COMMENT### The cult has already served its purpose, getting the GOP control in this election cycle.

If they implement Project 2025, they won't really need it to maintain that control.

Honestly I assume getting rid of Trump to be one of the final stages of the plan.

COMMENT### 
Honestly I assume getting rid of Trump to be one of the final stages of the plan.


It's gotta be. 

Why else run someone as young and inexperienced and unqualified as JD Vance?

COMMENT### it's peter thiel's master plan to become unofficial president. there's no way he planned this, though, he just got lucky

COMMENT### Maybe, though I imagine there will be backlash from the faithful if he's removed. How much, and what is done by them, we'll just have to wait and see.

I'm also curious to see what happens when the religious fundamentalist faction comes to a head against the tech bro faction that seems to be driving things this time around.

COMMENT### Unless Trump outright says "So and So will Make America Great Again after I die", there will be a schsim between the following factions:

Rich tech-bros
Evangelical Christians
Online Manosphere
Sov-Cit/anti-government libertarians

They're all projecting their specific hopes/dreams on Trump as a blank canvas, but once he kicks it they have to consolidate around someone else. 

Techbros would probably consolidate around Vivek or whoever Elon Musk tells them to, but that person wouldn't fly with Evangelicals. The sov-cits/libertarians I'm 99% sure will completely disengage once they don't have their "not a politician" and they start telling themselves the game is "rigged" and "he was just another corrupt billionaire".

Not to mention his kids will try to carry on the "legacy", but that'll have the energy of a Grateful Dead coverband and just be another grift.

COMMENT### Honestly there have been examples of cults and such where the original leader clearly said "X is going to carry on my legacy" and the group still devolved into infighting and fracturing.

COMMENT### Does anyone remember who the Fuhrer was after Hitler died?

COMMENT### I think this is going to happen no matter what when he is gone. JD Vance is not going to hold that group together. Most of the tech bros I have met who support this are accelerationists. If we get a proper P2025 totalitarian state they will turn on it hard alongside the libertarians. In that world it would be everyone vs. Evangelicals

COMMENT### White nationalists versus the billionaires 

It’ll be an epic fight

COMMENT### Imagine being in a cult where you worship this useless sack of shit? Lol

COMMENT### This is what I'm thinking.

They seem to really not like Vance.

COMMENT### 
They seem to really not like Vance.


Probably the only thing we can all agree on.

COMMENT### What difference will that make? Damage will be long done by then. People act like there will be a ‘26 or a ‘28 and beyond that they can exercise their political power. That is not a guarantee.

COMMENT### A reason why they are calling for punishment of anyone who doesn't want to suckle on his taint. Think he's just gonna stop at random brown people?

COMMENT### I understand your viewpoint but his successors will likely not be more competent. None of them approach Trump's appeal with the Republican base except for perhaps Ramaswamy, who will likely not last in Trump's cabinet owing to his outspokenness. JD Vance is not a popular or especially accomplished politician and it is hard to see him succeeding as Trump's heir apparent. Trump's children are sometimes thrown around as being potential successors but are on the whole odious rich kids, which is obvious to anybody with two eyes.

I don't see Trumpism lasting much longer than the man himself; as we've seen in the last few years, Trumpist candidates for Congress (Lake, Mastriano, Mike Rogers, Masters, etc etc) significantly underperform Trump himself. Compare this to swing state Dem Senate candidates largely outperforming Kamala in this election. This is, in my view, a healthier situation for a party to be in: the party is stronger than the candidate, while for Republicans the candidate is by leaps and bounds more popular than the party.

COMMENT### Seriously. We wish it was as easy as waiting out Trump

COMMENT### For one, I would love to see it happen, but in reality, he won't be 25th'd no matter what. It would crater the GOP, they need him and going against him would result in his supporters just not turning out.

COMMENT### Will there be though? You’re assuming all those fascists will willingly fall in line behind JD Vance. There will be full pandemonium in the Republican Party when Trump is gone to grab that power. Then add the fact literally no one except perhaps JD Vance voted for JD Vance, so that cult/voting base will also be in chaos. It’s going to be objectively funny

COMMENT### We should trick him into eating more McDonalds.

COMMENT### It doesn't matter the damage will be catastrophic and that not counting there's a chance we never get a fair election anymore.

COMMENT### You think Vance won’t be like “wait now I get all this power? Let’s keep the train rolling boys!!!”?

COMMENT### McDonalds preventing a constitutional crisis would be pretty American

COMMENT### We underestimate how having the best healthcare in the country can make the most unhealthy person live that much longer.

COMMENT### Exactly. Plus it's obvious he had a stroke at some point since 2016. Tick Tock. Tick Tock.

COMMENT### He's likely to go blind in his right eye due to the sonic shock of that bullet passing so closely to his skull.

COMMENT### We been saying that for years, though I legit assumed his diet and lack of exercise was going to put him in a tacky gold box before now

COMMENT### Ya and if he somehow gets term limits removed then Obama is coming back.

COMMENT### Ahh yes. President Vance sounds so much better. Good lord I'm in a position where I hope Trump lives.

COMMENT### Vance is more competent, but lacks charisma and the cult like following Trump gets. Republicans are far more likely to stand up to him than they are Trump.

COMMENT### I do not have faith in that. Vance is more competent and is surronded by Trump loyalists. If given the presidency I fear he'd go full scorched Earth

COMMENT### It helps a little bit

COMMENT### Yet there are people that could be potentially worse that he has put into high positions

COMMENT### It's like none of you mfers watch futurama!! 2028 will be floating head in a jar trump

COMMENT### Here’s the thing, if their plan is to allow a 3rd term, it’s no stretch for them to change the line of succession to just be Jr instead of an election. The amount of lawbreaking is essentially the same.

COMMENT### Well the doctors could have done the right thing and let him die of Covid back then. Instead they chose to “do no harm even if that obviously will cause more harm down the line”.

COMMENT### Again, I reiterate, i despise MAGA for shoving this A-hole down our throats.

I hate the lying too. No group of people have lied to me as much as maga voters have. It's like they think they can make everything better by simply lying. Dealing with non stop lying for a decade is exhausting.

COMMENT### Term limit gets lifted we will see Obama v Trump

COMMENT### No way, they’ll do something like “you can run for a third term but only if you’re currently in office running for re-election.”

Republicans have no shame or principles. Just pure thirst for power.

COMMENT### Obama is going to go on a long vacation overseas.

COMMENT### Dude's not in great health. Nature alone dictates he may not get a say. People saying Biden was too old then ignoring Trump's incoherent behavior are wild

COMMENT### "I suspect I won't be running again, unless you say, 'he's so good, we've got to figure something else."

"You know, FDR, 16 years — almost 16 years. He was four-term," Trump said. "I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term or two-term? You tell me."

COMMENT### The mob boss talk.

COMMENT### You don't think JD Vance, Rubio, or any of the other characters circling around Trump want more than life itself to be the next president?  What do you think happens when Trump gets in the way of their ambitions?  Trump has this nasty habit of appointing a loyal opposition detector - see Matt Gaetz, either Matt Gaetz either gets elected and becomes the most loyal lap dog to Trump ever, or the people who oppose Matt Gaetz are understood as not being aligned with Trump, what do you think happens to them?  In the case of JD Vance he can't be removed - he has nothing to lose in opposing Trump

COMMENT### Yeah. Don’t be surprised if they do everything they can in legislative and practical terms to esure they stay in power, even after Trump..

COMMENT### 
being term limited


Laws only matter as long as the people in power respect them.

COMMENT### Lame Dick President

COMMENT### He may have won the popular vote, but the margin he won by has been shrinking for quite a while. It's at 1.7% currently.

COMMENT### Yeah, idk why people were so hasty to call it a mandate when a blue state with 38 million people was at 60 percent reporting for the longest time.

COMMENT### Because republicans are great at messaging. That narrative has and will stick because people aren’t going to be keeping tabs on the election results at this point.

COMMENT### The Republicans are amazing at messaging. The Dems need to study that.

COMMENT### Because it doesn’t matter when Republicans have all three branches of government and both houses of the Legislature. That’s reason enough for them to enact whatever policy they want.

COMMENT### No one is calling it a mandate except Trump, but the media repeats it because it's what Trumps says. 

The media loves Trump, they love him as a villain, but they love him. They will gleefully report on human rights abuses, his numerous other crimes against humans and abuse of our nations and the weakening if America.

COMMENT### Who gives a shit?  Trump has a Republican Congress under his heel and the Presidency; that's as much of a mandate as you can get in the US

COMMENT### I mean, it is a mandate. It may not be as big a blowout as they were pushing early on, but the GOP now controls all the levers of federal power.

COMMENT### It isn't a mandate.

COMMENT### It is still a mystery why ANYONE voted for the 78 year old lying, felon. Yet here we are. He is disrespectful to anyone he comes in contact with especially women. He cheats on his wife.  He is destroying the country with hate and racism just to keep himself out prison. 

COMMENT### I don't think it's much of a mystery. The party in power was always going to be unfairly blamed for global inflation. Incumbents around the world are getting their asses handed to them over it. 

I don't know if there's much Harris could have done differently in response to it. Maybe trying to break with Biden more forcefully, but as his VP it's possible she was just inexorably tied to him no matter what she said or did.

COMMENT### 
I don't know if there's much Harris could have done differently in response to it. 


Instead of using Mark Cuban as a mouthpiece, she could have called price gouging CEOs SOBs. The media would have been scandalized. They would have gone on for days about how unpresidential and angry she is. But voters would have seen someone angry at the people taking their money.

Trump might even have defended CEOs, making him look elitist.

COMMENT### I would have liked to see how a move like that played out, but Trump and MAGA have successfully convinced Americans that CEOs aren't the problem and it's immigrants taking all their money. So I'm not sure if pointing out the real problem would have helped her much.

COMMENT### "even when it was the bears, I knew it was the immigrants"

oh, people are mad at corporations too. Harris needed to direct their anger instead of trying to soothe it.

COMMENT### Bernie made it work. If it failed, it would more have more likely been the messenger or the form than the messenger.

COMMENT### As much as inflation isn’t (for the most part) something the president controls and considering that the US is doing better than most countries it still was an absolute garbage move to continue to hammer the voters with “everything is fine actually the economy is great look at the stock market!”.  I don’t know how much it moved the needle but it definitely pissed off a lot of people everything they did this messaging.

Telling working people the economy is great when their groceries are constantly getting more expensive, they’re not making rent, housing prices skyrocket, and wages stagnate is gonna piss people off.  Again, I don’t know how much it moved the needle, but it felt really insulting to a lot of people to gaslight them when their actual lived experience in America is dog shit right now.

COMMENT### I live in Central Minnesota.  I know a number of people that think the guy is an asshole.  They basically voted for him because they were raised republican and catholic so they have remained republican and catholic their entire lives.  They don't give a shit about abortion, gay rights or basically any other social issues.  Their vote boils down to "My money is not getting me as far as it used to at the grocery store and my gas is more expensive."  This guy is a republican and he will fix that.  He gets my vote.

COMMENT### It's not a mystery. People were hurting before Biden and still are. Kamala ran on four more years of "this", and people hate "this". 

So they voted for the guy claiming he'll fix everything. 

COMMENT### I wished biden just signed a law requiring the future president to not be a felon. Ultimately blocking trump from ever becoming president.

I know it's not that simple or probably not possible but I want to believe. It's some sad shit that's happening.

COMMENT### That's probably not constitutional, even before the current scotus.

COMMENT### Buddy, lemme introduce you to a little something called the legislative branch.  We can’t get boring stuff passed in both houses something like that would be so DOA it wouldn’t be worth the cost of the printer ink.

COMMENT### If you haven’t noticed by now, morals in no way factors into who people vote for anymore.

Everyone keeps pointing out the countless (and I mean countless) moral failings of this dip shit. 

But there is no point to keep repeating it. It falls on deaf ears. The people who voted for him DO NOT CARE. 

COMMENT### It doesn't matter. The media already has touted it for almost a month that he has. The narrative will never change, despite the facts showing otherwise.

COMMENT### I just saw a meme yesterday talking about how 15 million democrats stayed home compared to 2020.  Last I checked it was at 7.  Still a huge wtf but it's not quite the "we must dissolve the entire democratic party" sentiment that was going on on election night.

COMMENT### Hmm. That sounds familiar.. 🤔

COMMENT### which literally means he does have the majority and popular vote

COMMENT### 1.7% is quite a bit.

COMMENT### Is this all the fuck we have left now?

Arguing about how bad or not-so-bad we lost?

We lost. They have the White House, the House, the Senate, the SCOTUS, and more governors. 

Do you guys remember the final score of the 1993 NBA finals? Fuck no. You just know that the Bulls won. None of this matters and isn’t what the left should focus on.

COMMENT### It’s truly AMAZING that a guy with so much baggage was still viewed as viable by so many Americans. It is sad because Trump is an unwell, vile and DANGEROUS person - and if he is successful in his plans the world will forever change (and not in a good way).  

COMMENT### Republicans voters feel heard by Trump. Democratic voters do not feel heard by Biden or Harris.

COMMENT### Are Democratic presidential candidates even allowed to make democratic voters feel heard on a national stage? There must be a reason why they don’t.

COMMENT### Republican voters feeling heard by Trump is honest to god the much bigger problem. NO ONE should feel heard by Trump. Anybody who feels heard by Trump should be locked the fuck up for their own good. But a third of the country is like that. Mortifying.

COMMENT### Yeah, but that's such a ridiculous excuse (I'm not saying that about you personally, just in general).

Imagine I had to choose one thing to have for dinner every night for the next 4 years. I could choose Lunchables or a moldy pile of garbage wrapped in a shiny container. Can you imagine someone choosing the moldy pile of garbage, or choosing to starve, because "the Lunchables didn't speak to me"?! It's such bullshit. 

Vote for someone who doesn't care about you because that's better than voting for someone who doesn't care about you and doesn't care about this country and wants to make life more difficult for people.

COMMENT### Wow, that's a really good way of putting it. Thanks.

COMMENT### Nor should they.  Everyone said Biden is a joke so they pitched his VP that has all the same policies and just said well, I'm not DJT he's weird.  Like being weird is some kinda gotcha.

COMMENT### I want to say that ignorant, sensationalist comments like this are what cause me to question the democrats. I've voted democrat my whole life, but when I see stuff like this it makes me cringe. Republicans are people too, and posts like this show that many "vote blue no matter who" people make zero attempt in understanding why people think differently than they do. These are normal, logical, everyday Americans just like you. Half of voters voted for him. Could be your friends, family, neighbor, etc.  If you want people to be on your side you must first understand them. Otherwise you will shun them, alienate them, and then wonder why they're voting against you.

COMMENT### I don't think the left is focusing on this. It's just an article pointing out it's showing the result is closer than previously reported.

You may not care about a distinction between a blow out and a narrow win, but the data is important regardless because it drives us closer to the truth as to who voted for him and why.

COMMENT### People voted for him because they either bought the bullshit disinformation being pushed on them through social media/main-stream-media, they are sexist, or they are racist.

Nobody that has even a fucking shred of empathy and actually knows what he stands for would have voted for him,.

COMMENT### It’s also worth noting that a big part of a lot of our collective grief is the shattering of our perceptions of American people. That last time he won, he lost the popular vote, so it felt like “hey, at least the majority of Americans see his politics as revolting.” It’s pretty horrific to think so many people see his actions as good.

COMMENT### He won the electoral college 58% to 42%

He won all seven “must win” swing states

Biden won the popular vote by 7 million and Trump won it by 1 million which is an 8 million vote swing in MAGA’s favor

That’s a big win.

COMMENT### Blow out or not, the data is important because it drives us closer to the truth as to who voted for him and why.

Politics is not a basketball game.

COMMENT### Redditors are absolutely not concerned with the "and why".

COMMENT### Well, one of them is!

COMMENT### 
He won the electoral college 58% to 42%


Using a percentage to represent electoral college votes is just strange, particularly given the article you’re commenting on.

COMMENT### I actually had no idea the Bulls won.

COMMENT### Yeah it was just decided yesterday

COMMENT### Yesterday? Sorry, I don't follow old news.

COMMENT### Yeah, Kamala could’ve ended up winning the popular vote for all I care, doesn’t change the fact of the matter that they won everything else that’s more important

COMMENT### This isn’t about winning or not winning it’s about understanding that what we’re doing isn’t working to get the votes of the majority of the population anymore. A lot of our identity politics and economics is simply not popular, it doesn’t matter how right it is.

COMMENT### I don't think it has anything to do with policy. Identity politics....maybe a little?

But Trumps policies are basically "make everything worse for everyone except my super super rich buddies"

What matters, apparently, is just some collection of media headlines. It doesn't matter how much those headlines lie, how big those lies are, just that the lies make Harris look bad.

I'm sure the anti-incumbent sentiment didn't help but there is no policy proposal where trump is better than Harris for anyone except for the people who can corrupt Trump.

COMMENT### You can go down the rabbit hole that the senators from the swing states where Democrats won and there were a significant amount of ballots that were not filled out beyond the president in Nevada, Arizona, and I think I heard Pennsylvania.

COMMENT### 
Is this all the fuck we have left now?


I mean technically speaking the answer to that is "no".

The actual election for the president doesn't happen until December 16th.  The election we participated in was technically just to choose which set of electorates get to cast their electoral votes on 12/16.

Now, there's absolutely no reason to believe that there will be enough "faithless electors" (ie. Electors that vote against their state's election results) to change the results since each party gets to pick their electoral voters and you wouldn't put people in that position that'll flip on you, but I can assure you that as we get closer to that date THAT will be the "thread of hope" that people will cling to.

Then after that on Jan 6th there will be the actual counting of those electoral votes and the certification of the electoral college's election by the sitting VP, Kamala Harris.  THAT will become the new "thread of hope".

Then after that on Jan 20th is when the new president is sworn in.  Something going awry with that will become the new "thread of hope".

Basically, strap yourself in, the next few months is going to be nothing but more election talk and pipe dreams that while technically plausible, are highly improbable.

COMMENT### Does not change a thing. Welcome to project 2025

COMMENT### Yup. Trump hates immigrants, the poor, POCs (and literally everyone else). Every relationship is purely transactional to him. He's a literal psychopath, and I'm not exaggerating at all.

COMMENT### It’s wild that people are still denying that’s going to be a thing even after the last 2 weeks of horrifying cabinet picks.

COMMENT### As Mark Twain once opined, "it's easier to con someone than to convince them they've been conned." 

How sad it is that some individuals believe that scientists, scholars, historians, economists, and journalists have devoted their entire lives to deceiving them, while a reality tv star with decades of fraud and exhaustively documented lying is their only beacon of truth and honesty.

COMMENT### It's easy to blame people for the lack of critical thinking and trusting our institutions but like most things, it's not that black and white. 

These institutions have left the public vulnerable when they were deceiving the public. For example, the FDA. While generally working in the public interest there are situations like what happened with Oxycotin where FDA officials were given super cush jobs once they left the agency by the drug manufacturer in exchange for not looking too closely at the data and agreeing to the higher dosages or in that they really only consider treatments that involve patented medicine which leaves the public vulnerable to snake oil salesmen that tout supplements and food remedies. Since there is a gaping hole in what the FDA allows for treatment in those areas people tend to believe a lot of noise. 

In addition everyone knows that the victors write history (so it's not completely objective), scholars and economist disagree so while one will say one thing another will say the opposite especially on forecasting, and journalist are beholden to editorial choices which leads to conflicting info. None of these disciplines are black and white on a whole. So people are left vulnerable to the conmen. That doesn't give the conman a pass by any means but it shows areas we need to do better and have better ways to know that they can be trusted.

COMMENT### Correct, but he won the plurality and no one is really saying that he won the majority. The language people have been using is that he won the Popular Vote, which is still accurate.

COMMENT### Trump himself is talking up his big win, that’s what the article is about. When in reality, only 5 elections in our history have had slimmer margins and trumps will continue to slide as more counts are finalized. Harris trailed by 1.6% so far.

COMMENT### I hear it all. I’m even hearing “most of America voted for Trump” and other such claims (only 21% of Americans voted for Trump).

COMMENT### Less than 60 percent of voter age Americans vote. Barely half of them voted for Trump. So the numbers being 30 percent or lower is accurate. For both parties.

COMMENT### 86% of Colorado voters voted this year. 

I know the vbm states are all high %. Wonder where the dropoff is

COMMENT### Considering most Americans didn't have at all, it's technically true.

COMMENT### Trump himself is talking up his big win, that’s what the article is about. When in reality, only 5 elections in our history have had slimmer margins and trumps will continue to slide as more counts are finalized. Harris trailed by 1.6% so far.

COMMENT### This.

Here's the meat of the article


As of Monday afternoon, Trump was at 49.94, while Harris was at 48.26,

Trump’s still ahead of Harris in the popular vote.


COMMENT### Trump doesn't care and he'll rule (not "govern") like he has an overwhelming mandate. 

COMMENT### This article is nothing but desperate copium. Even if he lost there are still some 70 million people voting for the twice impeached rapist felon. That's going to be a problem. Solve that problem and maybe we have a chance at fixing America.

COMMENT### It doesn’t matter if he did win the majority or not, he’s going to abuse the power of the office worse than he did the first time.

COMMENT### It's a shame that the popular vote doesn't count more. It feels like the system is broken when the candidate with fewer votes can still win.

COMMENT### Imagine if a Democrat lost the popular vote and won via the electoral college. The right would push to abolish it real quick.

COMMENT### He won the popular vote just not the majority, neither of the top 2 candidates currently hold 50%+ of votes casted.

COMMENT### I mean he won the popular vote nationally as well. But the popular vote on a state level matters a whole lot more because of the college. But both are important

COMMENT### Part of me wonders if he’s going to spend his whole presidency screaming at people.  Is he actually incentivized to DO anything?  He doesn’t give a fuck about re-election.  He’s talked about wanting to run for a third term but he’s gonna be older than Biden by then and totally incoherent if he’s still alive.

COMMENT### Eventually all of this will start to wear off and it will just be work.  That's when the golfing and delegation will really kick in.

COMMENT### And yet we keep hearing the word “mandate”.

COMMENT### I don't even know what a mandate is in a two-party system.  You either have the votes or you don't.

COMMENT### In this case, winning the EC and popular vote is a mandate.  Having the White House, the Senate, and the House gives him a mandate.

There's no angle where anyone can say "but actually..." because the GOP won across the board and it wasn't really close.  That's the mandate in this situation.

Trump did not have a mandate when he won in 2016.

COMMENT### Doesn't matter.

He could've won by a single vote and MAGA would call it a landslide and a mandate.  

They're entire worldview relies on them convincing themselves that reality is real.

COMMENT### It tells you a lot when even on r/politics the main response to such pieces of… news is “This is copium, can we please move on?”

So, please, can we move on? Democrats lost, republicans won. Time to think about the future.

COMMENT### What an insanely misleading headline.

He still has the popular vote.

COMMENT### He hit something like 49.9%. So while this statement is technically true, it’s a heavy cope. We all have to find a way to accept the fact that a huge portion of our fellow countrymen are fucking idiots.

COMMENT### Who cares? This clown getting even a single vote should be a wake up call for us that something is broken

COMMENT### One can only hope that the incompetence of his team (meaning stephen miller), and his own incompetence, hamstring him from causing too much damage.

Get ready for the Trump crime family to loot the country.

COMMENT### I’m still betting he gets recalled while in office

COMMENT### The only way for the US to become a functional democracy: Folks in enough heavily blue areas (I'm looking at you LA) need to move to purple areas and light red areas, and then vote to eliminate the electoral college.

COMMENT### Get off the copium, it’s really embarrassing

COMMENT### If there was ever a time for a recount, it's now.

COMMENT### So what?  He won, whether with 50% or 49% it doesn’t matter.  We hear “now he doesn’t have a mandate”. What does that even mean?  He had the senate and house for 2 years at least.  Mandate or not, if they want to do something they will.

COMMENT### They had both houses during his first stint in the Whitehouse and didn't accomplish shit.

COMMENT### That’s true. And that may be the case again, although the senate will likely have 53 v 52 and has less moderates.  There is no McCain to save the day if need be. 

My point still stands. Even if won the election by 10pts and 20 EV he has the same power as if he won 270-268 and by less than 1%

COMMENT### These articles are hilarious. Who are they for?

COMMENT### Democrats who don't want to change - they're purely an alternative to looking in the mirror

COMMENT### Democrats talk so much about democracy.... until someone they don't like wins. Then it's every reason under the sun except losing they talk about. 

And I say that as a democrat who wants change, this election was such an embarrassment.

COMMENT### They might be modeling 20th century European fascism, but IMO they’re lacking the actual WW1-hardened organization, competence, and pragmatism.  I think this this baptism happens relatively quickly - historically speaking.

It’s gonna be a very bumpy ride, but when they crash this plane into the mountain (and a lot of people are going to get hurt), the coalition that will rise in the ashes might finally be the progressive, forward thinking future that was previously unachievable through proper reform.  

The big thing that has me worried, ironically, is Liz Warren’s CBDC being deployed by the Trump administration.  If federally issued financial support (Medicaid, Medicare, SS, Food Stamps, Finacial Aid, Biz Grants) is fully digital and surveilled (and can be shut off with the touch of a button for the ‘undesirables’) - we really get into some Orwellian shit.

Who coulda seen Democrats becoming Libertarians coming? 

Helluva timeline we’re living in.

COMMENT### I bet they continue to say their new favorite word “mandate” and that they “have a mandate from the American people to ruin the country”

COMMENT### I lost a chess game but I had one more pawn at the end.

COMMENT### Here we go again.

COMMENT### Doesn’t change a thing BUT it does make me want to do a full recount by hand. Just for shits and giggles at this point cause I don’t believe these results still honestly.

COMMENT### It’s always been popular vote, not majority vote lol.

COMMENT### Jonathan could barely see as he was led into the Tesla My Pillow Coliseum, the lights flashing in time to the Kid Rock January 6th True America Trump Anthem while the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders flanked him and the other forced attendees, funneling them into the main arena to be seated for the movie. As the re-education begins, a woman leans over to Jonathan and whispers "HE DIDN'T WIN A MAJORITY OF VOTES" right before the drone sweeps down and plucks her from the group, her destination a factory in Iowa where she will contract bile duct cancer from the paint used to make the Dear Leader's latest line of high top sneakers for whispering such blasphemy.

COMMENT### Huh? He’s set to gain over 270 electoral votes. More than enough needed to become president. The headline is misleading.

COMMENT### So what was the total vote count? I know it won’t change anything as he won the electoral college but it’s nice to know. Last I checked Kamala was at 71mil and trump was at 79mil

COMMENT### As much as I can not stand certain ppl, he still got more ballots so far.

COMMENT### This feels like copium. 

Majority can also just mean the greater number. Which he will still win.

If you want to be extra nitpicky and say he won the plurality, sure go ahead. But it feels like the Democrat version of "it's not a democracy, it's a republic."

COMMENT### Trump has never had and never will have a mandate. Just the facts. He's got tepid support at best, and that's certain to be in steady decline.

COMMENT### Once he's off the ballot Republicans are in big trouble. People are voting for HIM. They don't like his kids, they don't really like his friends. They worship Trump.

COMMENT### Do you think people would have worshiped Jesus' kids? Would it be considered nepotistic or does God's love not work that way?

COMMENT### EVERY single state shifted their vote to the right since 2020. Alongside the decisive EC win and sweeping every swing state, that is a mandate for sure.

COMMENT### Even California shifted to the right by quite a bit. 

Look how many counties went red.

COMMENT### Yes, New York and New Jersey also. Some of the bluest states had the largest red-shift, which I guess makes sense. Odd that the swing states had the SMALLEST shift to the right. But enough.

COMMENT### There is no way he did. Voter turn out was massive and people were very resolute about electing Kamala and keeping him out. Due to Musk's involvement and his publicly expressed fear of arrest for his criminal acts I have zero trust in the data compilation that purports to have tallied the votes.

COMMENT### I don't know what kind of semantics this headline is trying to peddle, but the article itself directly contradicts it when it says he still has more votes than Harris.

COMMENT### I'm not seeing anything from any other source that suggests this...

COMMENT### You know a majority of redditors who see this post title (and only that) will assume that this means Harris got more votes than him.

COMMENT### The fact we’re still counting ballots is insane

COMMENT### He still won.  Isn’t that the point?

COMMENT### The closest thing he’ll get to a “mandate” is all the quality time he’s spending with Edolf Muskler

COMMENT### He won the majority of electoral votes.  That is all that matters.

COMMENT### The electoral college hasn't voted yet. That happens on December 16th, and those votes are sealed until they are counted on January 6th, and certified by Harris herself.

It's extremely unlikely that anything will change due to the way it's all set up, but get ready for social media to continue to be in a frenzy over this election until at least february as the full election process actually plays out.

COMMENT### Lol Dems do so well at 4 AM and days after elections. Weird. No ID required to register or vote either. Hmmm

COMMENT### He is still your president

COMMENT### He’s been quite open about not having any intention of being president of all Americans and proved it during his first term, so no he’s not.

COMMENT### This is pure copium. The only thing other than winning the presidency that matters is the popular vote. Trump is still winning it by 2.6 M votes.

COMMENT### He needs to borrow LBJ’s ballot box. It’s a sure win!

COMMENT### They don’t care. All they can muster in terms of intelligence is “his number bigger mean majority!”

COMMENT### It won’t matter to him or his followers. They proclaim whatever makes them feel better

COMMENT### ELI5?

COMMENT### Shew that’s a relief

COMMENT### “the United States takes time to count 155,000,000 million votes”

Yes it would take time to count more votes than have ever been cast in the history of the country.

COMMENT### So? He still has all the power, nothing to stop him, and worst, no reason to behave - he cannot be president ever again (god felt so good writing the last part).

COMMENT### lol “Trump can no longer claim that powerful mandate” yes i’m sure he’ll correct that post haste

COMMENT### So much for that 'mandate'.

COMMENT### Doesn’t make any difference if he won by 1% or 10%.  Trump will do whatever he wants either way.

COMMENT### He has the White House, both chambers of Congress, and the Supreme Court. Also having the popular vote is inconsequential. At best, it’s a blow to his fragile ego.

COMMENT### Moral victories are meaningless when the end result is the same

COMMENT### Dumbest headline ever. Still cooked Kamala. We’re still fucked.

COMMENT### And? He can still fuck everything up just the same.
