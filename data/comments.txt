###COMMENT: First pro Rape government in history

###COMMENT: Not just rape, CHILD rape. They're pro CHILD rape. 

The president is Jeffrey Epstein's best friend. True story.

###COMMENT: There is a strong possibility Gaetz was cavorting on Epstein's island, by sheer proximity alone.

###COMMENT: I still am flabbergasted.

Like, there are a ton of evil geniuses who Trump could have tapped for this post.  Republicans who have horrible agendas...and actual competence.  I suppose the "lack of competence" thing is a point in America's favor, but still...fucking Matt Gaetz?

Like...child sex trafficker Matt Gaetz?  Butthead doppelganger Matt Gaetz?  Human fraternity paddle Matt Gaetz?  Just...fucking Christ, man.  It's like when they have those reality TV shows that have had so many seasons that viewers get bored, so they do an all-stars season with the "best of the best" (aka worst of the worst) to freshen things up.

###COMMENT: The only thing Trump cares about is loyalty to Trump.  That's it.  Rubio and Gaetz spent the last 8 years sucking Trump's asshole sparkly-clean.

###COMMENT: I guess impeach….right, legislature and scotus. Welp. Murica

###COMMENT: They had to do it for 8 years because as soon as they finish, he spews more shit.

###COMMENT: Because those evil geniuses might have thoughts beyond I must do whatever Trump wants me to do.

###COMMENT: This is the only legit answer. He has to fill his cabinet with idiots who suck up to him. Because anyone who isn’t, or won’t, wouldn’t be caught dead working for him.

Imagine being so CNN a shit pile that only Matt Gaetz will work for you…

###COMMENT: The only thing Trump has been successful at is reality tv. The secret to reality tv is chaos. Create chaos is what trump does because that is how you get the ratings. He picks people for how they look on the screen. He's an actor from the reality tv world casting a reality show.

###COMMENT: And, let's not forget, the guy who used venmo to pay for his crimes.

###COMMENT: The only good thing about this is that the GOP hate Matt "You look older than 16" Gaetz more than just about anyone.

###COMMENT: Perhaps incompetence is a feature and not a flaw, given Trump’s own hatred for his own prosecution by DOJ (or persecution, if you look at it from Trumps’s narcissistic viewpoint).

###COMMENT: The only thing that may save us is that his appointees are evil but incompetent.

###COMMENT: None of this was a secret. Still, America voted GOP in a landslide.

Welcome to Trumpamerica

###COMMENT: I don't understand why we didn't hammer that. Every interview, every debate, every news program should have been talking non stop about his ties to epstein, how many times he flew on the plane, his past accusations and comments about underage girls etc. We had so much ammo  on this guy and we did and said nothing. He never gets corrected, he never gets held accountable, no one ever brings up anything like that to his face. WHY? Please make it make sense. If this was the other way around. They would be talking about it on fox news nonstop. Every show, every pundit, every damn segment would have been about it. Makes the whole thing seem rigged from the get go.

###COMMENT: Their side can do nothing wrong, while our side does everything wrong.

Simple as.

###COMMENT: No, Democrats should have flooded are meme websites with pictures of Trump and Epstein.

Democrats are weak at running meme and social media campaigns. They need their own troll farms. They need their own dank memes. 

###COMMENT: Memes are not professional. Dems want to appear like educated professionals that take their job serious. They also lost because that is not the general public.

###COMMENT: 90% of the media outlets in America are owned by 6 companies. Five of those 6 are owned and run by conservatives. 

We all suffer under conservative propoganda.

###COMMENT: If I'm not mistaken Kamala had a commercial that showed a photo of Trump with Epstein.  Same commercial also showed a photo of Trump with Vince McMahon, who stands accused of you guessed it, sex trafficking.

###COMMENT: Well, you know…eggs.  /s

###COMMENT: You know I have a low info coworker, a normie. They told me they don't vote for the person, they vote for the party. Their only association is GOP=lower taxes. That's the depth of their understanding. What is insulting is they have a PhD.

 People should be required to pass an exam in order to vote. Normies are destroying the world.

###COMMENT: 
Their only association is GOP=lower taxes


Wherein the difference the typical range of changes made here actually makes in the average person's pocket is negligible. So annoying and shortsighted to vote based on this.

###COMMENT: It's absolutely amazing that they don't realize "party over person" (and effectively, over policy) is such a bad look.

###COMMENT: A PhD in what?!?!  Jesus fucking christ

###COMMENT: not to be all pedantic and shit but a 49.9% popular vote win is not a “landslide”

###COMMENT: But it was an electoral college landslide

###COMMENT: while true the unfortunate reality is that most news organizations failed to really treat it seriously or disclose it. On top of the amount of people that just disbelieve anything about the news, and then on top of that the large segment that is just willfully ignorant entirely.

The right’s biggest success was convincing post people to simply not care, and a large % of those who do to distrust everything

###COMMENT: “That’s all out of context y’all”-them

###COMMENT: However , stop stating it was a landslide. It was not a landslide. But yes it is apparent the American Government hates women. Period .Full stop

###COMMENT: And yet, somehow Hillary Clinton was supposedly the one running a pedo ring in a pizza shop.  Because postmenopausal women are sex fiends.

###COMMENT: Accuse the other side for that which you are guilty.

###COMMENT: And also connected to Diddy.

###COMMENT: Don't forget musk also.

###COMMENT: Wow, If only there was a crime that this guy could have been charged with. He could have been put away in prison so he wouldn't be around to be considered for this position.

It sure sucks that this guy committed no crime and can't be arrested and imprisoned for it. 

(Fuck Merrick Garland)

###COMMENT: The Supreme Court already proved that nothing Merrick Garland would have done would have mattered.  They were always going to let him off.  I don't know why people thought he would ever see justice.

###COMMENT: Hey now, the third pro-rape government in history, Jackson & Van Buren didn't seem to mind

###COMMENT: In US history

###COMMENT: Thomas Jefferson literally raped his slaves. People have a far too rosy view of our history

###COMMENT: We thought we had progressed. We hadn't.

###COMMENT: I guess we are going back.

###COMMENT: Can we please distinguish between modern history where the subjects of that history are still alive and the history of our past where none of those people are alive?

I get that America was founded on shit. We are the proverbial Indian graveyard just like in the The Shining. But it is disingenuous to pretend like progress was never made or that things haven’t changed since then.

###COMMENT: Even in the 18th century, plenty of people knew slavery was a moral failure.  Less than a ¼ of the population owned slaves.

###COMMENT: Forgetting history is how we got into this mess in the first place, so no

###COMMENT: I’m not saying to forget history. You want us to forget that things changed and made progress.

###COMMENT: How can we acknowledge how much things have changed if we can’t acknowledge how bad things were in the past?

###COMMENT: 12 different Presidents owned slaves

###COMMENT: and enslaved his own children

###COMMENT: Thomas Jefferson owned a man whose sole purpose was to make macaroni and cheese, and raped that man’s sister.

###COMMENT: We're number one! We're number one! 

Who is with me?! Guys?

###COMMENT: Unfortunately, no

###COMMENT: the first pedocracy

###COMMENT: That’s false and you know it

###COMMENT: Family values tho.

###COMMENT: Everyone calls him a pedophile, multiple investigations opened on him but he still gets to stay in office and even promoted now. The justice system does not exist.

###COMMENT: I get the sentiment being expressed and I sympathize but many many governments in history were pro rape. Letting victorious soldiers rape the local woman was just an average city sacking back in the day.

###COMMENT: 
would destroy the agency, quite possibly forever 


Obviously that’s the reason he was picked

###COMMENT: Yeah, that's the point

###COMMENT: It's not a bug, it's a feature

###COMMENT: yeah idea of an independent justice department is completely gone. it’ll be a tool to consolidate power

###COMMENT: They won't completely destroy it because they want to use it against anyone who opposes them like news media that won't sell to MAGA owners.

###COMMENT: That’s the point of all trumps picks so far… this is also explicitly what he campaigned on

###COMMENT: Hmm.  It makes me wonder if they want to get rid of it so that it will be up to states and they can evade justice in a blue state by going to a lenient red state.

###COMMENT: If you read the Heritage Foundations Presidents new book, At Dawn's Early Light, it has excerpts like "America's Institutions are like deadwood that only need to be lit by Republicans brave enough to do so" and "The 2nd American revolution will be bloodless as long as the left allows it to be" meaning "as long as you let us fuck everything up, there will be no war". Sound familiar?

###COMMENT: There won't be any war. If Americans can't even be bothered to vote to defend democracy they sure as shit aren't going to take up arms and fight to defend it. We're cooked.

###COMMENT: There won't be any war, but there will be blood.  People will stand up for their rights, and Republicans will happily make an example of them.  They are out for blood over perceived slights of people opposing Trump.

###COMMENT: In May 1963, police in Birmingham, Alabama, responded to marching African American youth with fire hoses and police dogs to disperse the protesters, as the Birmingham jails already were filled to capacity with other civil rights protesters.

This is the type of violence you can expect today. Inevitably, as protests for civil rights break out, Trump will begin to leverage militant police and national guard against detractors with force. 

He's been open about using the military against American people for a year now. He's told voters exactly what he's going to do, and he's going to do it. This man idolizes people like Putin. The fact that 75M+ voters expected anything different is abhorrent.

###COMMENT: That's the issue. So many of those voters didn't really know anything, they didn't know what the candidates were even promising or not promising to do. They didn't know their stance on anything, or if they didn't have a stance.

They didn't know shit. And they voted anyway.

###COMMENT: Nah trust me man, once they start trying to ban porn, it all comes crumbling down. 

###COMMENT: Threaten rights of multiple minority groups: I sleep

Ban porn: REAL SHIT

###COMMENT: They are already restricting it in a lot of red states. Not slowing them down as much as you'd expect with work arounds still being out there.

###COMMENT: Hell, it's even affecting people in states where there are no restrictions. Kansas banned it and now I can't access redgifs simply because I live just across the border in Missouri

###COMMENT: Destroy democracy and the rule of law?  Not worth the effort.  Ban porn?  Lock and load, baby, we’re storming DC.

###COMMENT: Funny to think it didn’t all come tumbling down with women’s bodily rights being taken away, but that it will all come down if men don’t have the right to watch porn.  And I will love that.  (Not saying only men watch porn, but it’s way more men than women overall)

###COMMENT: Watch the documentary “Bad Faith” on Amazon Prime. 

Goes into the Heritage Foundation, Jerry Fuller, and Paul Weyrich. 

This is playing out for Christian nationalists in the most perfect way.

###COMMENT: Almost like they knew it would go this way...

###COMMENT: My friend they been planning this shit since the late 1960’s. 

Regan was the first try that failed. (Yes he was backed by the heritage foundation, they championed him and he essentially chose ultra capitalist over them… that made them mad but they got into the ultra capitalist game with the Koch’s)

Trump was the second try and he had too many guardrails. 

This time Trump has almost next to none and a more equipped and prepared backing… 

We ain’t never seen no shit like this before.

###COMMENT: Oh I know, Heritage has been around for a long time. GW Bush implemented a lot of their policies too. They've had the ear of conservative presidents for a long time. Project 2025 is no different, but it's certainly their most "take over the world" approach yet, something only enabled by an idiot like Trump.

###COMMENT: How will MAGA fanboys justify this

###COMMENT: I hang out in some conservative spaces and can tell you that they want the DOJ dismantled as revenge for the "lawfare" that was conducted against a "completely innocent" Trump.

###COMMENT: All of them forget or willingly ignore that DOJ also investigated Hunter Biden, with a complete lack of interference by Joe Biden, and Joe Biden won’t pardon him either.

But yeah, the “Biden crime family” is the issue.

###COMMENT: 100% Projection every single time with conservatives. They can only draw from experience on their smearing campaigns for they lack liberals' creativity, ideas and imagination.

###COMMENT: Joe needs to pardon him. Now.

###COMMENT: And state why as part of the pardon.

If the Trump DoJ were going to be another normal DoJ, I'd say let Hunger suffer whatever the consequences are for whatever he did. AFAICT, he committed a minor crime that would nomally warrant a fine and probation. It is not reasonable or just to let the wolves at him. So pardon him.

###COMMENT: That would be silly and gain nothing.

###COMMENT: Why?

###COMMENT: Why not? What has he/Democrats gained by taking the high road at every opportunity? 

Nothing has been gained, and everything lost.

###COMMENT: But this doesn't gain anything. We don't "win a point" if Biden pardons Hunter. Hunter is meaningless to everyone except his family.

If Biden is going to use his authority recklessly like that, it should at least be to do something that is a tangible gain to the country.

###COMMENT: Also don't forget the reopened investigation of a  certain candidate in October 2016

###COMMENT: It’s hard to imagine how the rule of law, would be political since…well you know, Congress made the laws.  So withstanding, republicans cite problems they made to justify why the government sucks.  

###COMMENT: They’ll still be licking the boot while it’s pressed down on their neck.

###COMMENT: When MAGA voters tell you a claim like this is overblown media frenzy, it's difficult to tell whether they're naive or whether they secretly want disaster to accelerate.

###COMMENT: Some of them are definitely accelerationists

###COMMENT: It's pure bigotry

###COMMENT: Those who want disaster to accelerate are largely naive. In fact, I'd argue that the vast majority of Trump voters are naive.

###COMMENT: A lot of them want literally zero government

###COMMENT: They're laughing that Gaetz' pick is "triggering the libs".

###COMMENT: By scapegoating the Democrats.

###COMMENT: They don't care.

###COMMENT: With a sick smile and a hearty 'own the libs' because that's all they know and care about

###COMMENT: "if the DoJ can target someone like Donald Trump, it can target anyone, therefore it needs to be destroyed"

###COMMENT: Gaetz will be canned by Trump before he can say, "tweet-fired"

###COMMENT: “But-buh Hunter Biden”

###COMMENT: They love this shit! 
MAGA stands for "Make America Go Away".

###COMMENT: frankly middle america doesn't know what DOJ does or is and it doesn't effect them in the slightest.

same for all letter agencies

###COMMENT: I was listening to one trump voter who didn't know a single cabinet pick, let alone why they were problematic.

It's almost like...what's the term... a cult of personality

###COMMENT: This is what they want, this is why they voted for Trump. How will they justify it? They will laugh with glee

###COMMENT: They are accelerationists, they want to bring the end of the world sooner so they can usher in the end of times.  These people are likely victims of led poisoning at a young age and a disconnection from reality due to physical abuse as children and all share a common daddy issue complex.  

###COMMENT: They're just there for the trolling and lolz.

###COMMENT: Rational people being horrified by it is justification to them

###COMMENT: "He knows all the legal loopholes, that's how he got away with diddling children, surely he'll fix them."

###COMMENT: They'll openly say he's a great pick and be unreseverdly happy about it in converation?

###COMMENT: oh easy.


The God Emperor wills it.
It makes libs cry.


That's it. Those are their criteria for something to be Good.

###COMMENT: They don't have to justify anything.  They can literally get away with anything.

###COMMENT: Destroying it forever is the goal.

Trump is doing exactly what he is being instructed to do. These are not Trump’s picks.

“The election campaign is over. To achieve success in the election, Donald Trump relied on certain forces to which he has corresponding obligations. As a responsible person, he will be obliged to fulfill them.” - Nikolai Patrushev, Russia’s intelligence chief Nov. 11, 2024

Trump’s mission for Russia is to dismantle the United States. 

That’s what is happening.

###COMMENT: Yep. They have Gaetz by the balls because they know what he did, and installed Gabbard to funnel intelligence to Russia to keep them happy so they don't (as they themselves threatened) assassinate Trump.

These people are all uniquely incompetent and their only commonality is their enthusiasm to comply with Russia (either voluntarily or via coercion).

###COMMENT: I don't think that they are being threatened. Putin understands never to threaten anyone you can bribe.

###COMMENT: Nah, it's strongly implied that if one doesn't take the bribe..

###COMMENT: Then... people find out he's a rapist? There's that and worse out in the open, but their voters have made clear they don't care. I don't think there's anything they would care about. Granted, if it's someone like Trump telling them to care, they might, but then who's that guy when they need to bring Trump into line.

Granted, this might be way too simple a way of looking at it, but still, given just how little Republican voters have shown to care about anything that comes up about Trump or whoever else, it makes me wonder if blackmail's really the driving force here.

###COMMENT: It's amazing how a country as weak as Russia has been able to take over our government in plain sight.

The gdp of Russia is 2 trillion. Slightly less than Canada.

###COMMENT: The wealth is concentrated in the hands of very few, and they’re very willing to put money in the pockets of conservatives across the globe, who are in turn willing to dismantle their own countries because it benefits them personally in the short term.

Once they take the first bribe, they’re completely compromised, and are willing to take the next. Russia has been extremely aggressive with its espionage and compromising conservative politicians across the globe for their own benefit, which the West has not. The corrupt politicians in adversarial countries are already bribed more by their own governments than they could be by ours, so there’s no incentive. Democracies have far less corruption, so bad actors on the right are willing to accept the bribes from adversaries.

###COMMENT: It's not even Russia - it's the ultra capitalists that went into Russia after the fall of communism. It's the same right wing that has been fighting for decades to take over the world.

###COMMENT: If they are in Russia, that makes it Russian, no?

###COMMENT: Watch the documentary “Bad Faith”

It’ll tell you more of what’s going on behind the scenes and how we got here.

Christian Nationalists, Ultra-capitalist, Tech Bro’s, and Neo-Nazi’s. 

They literally have joined hands to push MAGA further than they were able to push Regan the first time around. This country doesn’t even know what it’s in for..

But I agree Russia has joined in and finally found its way to destroy the superpower of America… it’ll be from within.

###COMMENT: Let's not forget. Donald Trump started the insurrection.

###COMMENT: This is the GOP plan across the board.  Drive out the career people that are dedicated to mission of these agencies and replace them with unqualified sycophants out to destroy the agencies.

###COMMENT: Dems hopefully are or at least should be planning on how to rebuild these agencies from the ground up. 2028 and beyond is gonna involve a lot of rebuilding. If we make it there without fully falling into fascism.

###COMMENT: And who will want to work there.  Pay is not great. Rigid advancement structure.  Payout is in benefits and retirement assuming Trump doesn’t destroy that too.  There is an insane amount of work that goes on in the agencies.  It is not going to be good.  People grumbling about government slowness and republicans are intentionally sabotaging it.

###COMMENT: From the article: 


If Senate Republicans do not draw the line here, then a line does not exist.


After their failure to impeach after the violent attempt to overthow the 2020 election I concluded that a line does not exist.

###COMMENT: Everywhere I see “he gets recess appointments, so he will get his picks”. Can a smart person confirm or explain what this is all about realistically?

###COMMENT: The US Constitution requires that department heads (aka cabinet members) may be appointed by the President "with the advice and consent of the Senate." What that means is that the Senate must agree with or approve the President's picks.

But the Constitution was written almost 250 years ago, and at that time it was expected that Congress would be out of session for long periods of time. The authors of the Constitution wanted to make sure that departments would not go without leadership just because Congress was out of session. So they added language that says, during a congressional recess, the President can make temporary appointments without Senate approval. Those are called "recess appointments."

In the modern era, there's really no reason not to wait until Congress is back in session. But the Supreme Court has ruled that the President can still make recess appointments to this day.

TLDR: Recess appointments are a constitutionally archaic but still valid way for a president to appoint senior officials without the consent of the Senate even when those appointments would normally require the approval of the Senate.

More details here:

###COMMENT: The Republicans have been working on destroying the US for a long time. Once you see it, you can’t not see it. 

What policy (foreign or domestic) the Republicans have installed has actually made the US stronger in the past 30 years?

###COMMENT: Trump is going to get us into a shooting war...and there's a damn good chance it won't be a foreign war.

###COMMENT: Trump is going to enable a ground invasion of the United States.  Not immediately, not even within his own lifetime.  But, if ever a foreign soldier sets foot on the continental U.S. for the purposes of conquest, it will be thanks to Trump.

###COMMENT: Alaska is really, really close to Russia. You don’t think he’ll let the Russians hop on over and start annexing territory?

###COMMENT: I would think not, if only because that would prevent him from maximizing oil production.  There is an awful lot of untouched wilderness up there he'd be happy to burn to the ground for some oil exec.

###COMMENT: I could see it being fully "symbolic" as in "look- we can take over part of your country and there is nothing you're going to do about it" vs actually getting something of value from it.

###COMMENT: Russia is also a petrol state. They’d love to get their hands on some new oil fields.

###COMMENT: True!  Honestly, you're probably right... if Putin and his oligarchs could cough up enough money, Trump would probably sell Alaska back to them.

###COMMENT: This all seems like a surreal dystopian nightmare.

###COMMENT: I take solace in the fact that the worst things in my life were unpredictable. So the more I can predict, the less likely those things are to happen. 

Still afraid of what I don’t know, but at least I can’t perseverate about it.

###COMMENT: Some say this is being histrionic, but we are about to see every federal institution change irrevocably. A lot of people are discounting that a lot of this is just trolling the libs or putting in crazies only have a more normie actually nominated. 

No, these people intend to do everything they said, think tanks have developed a game plan, both chambers of congress are subservient, the court will “interpret” the constitution the way Joseph Smith read magic gold bars in a hat in a closet to create Mormonism to say that this is actually what the founders wanted, and half the voting base is currently unswayable from decades of anti-democratic propaganda being poured in their heads at every turn. How can they vote for a party, when the political inclination and literal name of the party is a slur? In the gravelly unsettled voice of Limbaugh “liberal and democrat party”

The cabinet is being populated with true believers and cynics who only want to be on top of the garbage pile. And they are all prepared to jump when told by a man who may be fine and affable in the meeting with Biden but was totally ready to have his VP executed by a mob when he lost an election.

We are all in for a very rude awakening sooner than later.

###COMMENT: Well, the polite awakening method of treating others with respect and compassion hasn’t worked for many people, unfortunately. I’ve thought for years now that the only way half of this country will ever snap out of their delusion is if they feel the corruption personally. I thought Covid would be enough to make people see how corrupt the GOP is, but they learned the exact wrong lesson from that ordeal and now the people who caused millions of Americans to die an painfully agonizing death are back in charge for the next 4 years. God help us.

###COMMENT: Yeah, the earth will keep spinning and I will still probably grow old and die, but America is fucked

###COMMENT: Watch the documentary “Bad Faith”

It’ll explain a lot more of this shit…

This country is in a really dire situation and it might even be too late.

###COMMENT: Is it possible he won't pass Senate approval for AG?  He resigned from Congress so would he just go home and end up working for Fox news or something?

###COMMENT: Elon is threatening and bribing everybody now

###COMMENT: He could be a recess appointment, which doesn't require Senate approval. And there's a widely held belief that DeSantis would put him in Rubio's Senate seat if he can't be confirmed for AG. 

Either way, Gaetz wins.

###COMMENT: Senate confirmation hearings are a place where bold, inquisitive members of Congress may be able to cause some damage and/or embarrassment but that would require bold, inquisitive members of Congress.

###COMMENT: So the agency founded to fight the KKK will be brought by a pedo defending a nazi.

Nifty.

###COMMENT: They want to get rid of the FBI which means enemy nations would be able to spy on the US completely unhindered.  Trump is putting enemies of America in charge of our most important institutions.

Vivek Ramaswamy wants to shut the FBI with Elon Musk. Here’s what they’ll need to succeed

###COMMENT: So if they shut down the IRS does that mean we don’t have to pay taxes? I’m so confused of their game plan here.

###COMMENT: Their game plan is to destroy the United States on behalf of Russia.  Defunding it is part of the plan.

###COMMENT: It's the end game of their "Starve the Beast" strategy. Cut off funding at the source then axe government programs like social security and Medicare because we can't pay for them. Then billionaires can keep more of their money.

###COMMENT: It’s so fucking surreal. 

Idiocracy is a utopia compared to where this is heading.

###COMMENT: Macho Camacho would've made a better president...At least he knew when to defer to people with more smarts than he.

###COMMENT: It will get 1000 worse than you can imagine Elon will make sure of that

###COMMENT: I actually had to check to see if Gaetz was even a lawyer, which he apparently was for a moment or two.   With these MAGAt scumbags, I actually don’t know their histories or that they even have them.  I assumed they just spontaneously spawn out of a pile of dogshit. 

Gaetz, I didn’t realize was a rich boy political nepobaby,  though I guess I shouldn’t. E surprised. 

###COMMENT: That is their goal.

###COMMENT: How are people just now realizing that destroying our institutions was the plan all along?

###COMMENT: The Postillon, the German equivalent to The Onion, just published an article saying “Trump puts P Diddy in charge of women’s relations” :D

https://www.der-postillon.com/2024/11/trump-diddy.html

It’s in German, but here’s a translation:

Washington (dpo) - Donald Trump is causing a national and international stir with his cabinet appointments. Now another controversial appointment is making the rounds: Sean Combs, also known as P. Diddy or Puff Daddy, is to become the government’s Commissioner for Women’s Issues.

“Diddy knows women like no other,” reads a statement from Donald Trump. “He is excellent at organizing women when they are needed. He also has great social skills and treats women with the respect they deserve.”

The future president does not see the fact that P. Diddy is currently still in legal trouble because he is accused of human trafficking, rape, blackmail and drug abuse as a problem. “This is a classic conspiracy by the woke fakenews media,” said Trump. “My future Attorney General Matt Gaetz will see to it that this is dropped.”

As satisfied as Trump sounds now: According to insiders, Combs was only his third choice. Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein had previously been approached for the post. However, the former turned out to be dead, while the latter had to decline for health reasons.

###COMMENT: That is exactly what they want to do. I don’t get it they said they wanted to destroy government in its current form root out the corruption replacing it with more corruption. No matter what Skelton the media tries to throw out there no one cares.

###COMMENT: He's just a dictator. He wants to fire all people from the top army positions. For probably "his people" 

###COMMENT: My theory…this nomination is a feint. A nomination so bad that they don’t confirm him but the “second choice” has an easier time. And that second choice ends up being Aileen Cannon.

###COMMENT: Naaah, he wants Gaetz. He's probably got enough leverage over him for the pedo sex trafficking and possibly needing a pardon.

Cannon is as safe a choice since who knows she might develop a conscience and start to think for herself.

Matty boy is his best choice to dismantle the DOJ.

###COMMENT: I've given up....I've resigned to the couch eating my popcorn and screaming at the tv I TOLD YOU SO!!

###COMMENT: Don't worry. It will be a peaceful transition of power. That's what's important......

###COMMENT: The majority of Americans voted for this. Y'all going to LOVE the next 4 years 😉

###COMMENT: 4 years is optimistic af

###COMMENT: Not even.  The majority of Americans who bothered to vote.  It's still not even 1/3 of the country.

###COMMENT: It all depends on how quickly he can remove the age of consent. If that takes a while, it'll take all of his focus.

###COMMENT: I usually don’t agree with you clowns but this guy being investigated for sexual misconduct with minor, and the trafficking.  The fact that he quit the house before the ethics investigation came out on him to stop it from being released.   

And the fact that MAGA loves him and all the above is fake news…. Can’t believe it..

###COMMENT: Heres what my Senator, 91 yr old Chuck Grassley had to say


the likely incoming chairman of the Judiciary panel, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, also deflected, saying he doesn’t know Gaetz but will look at the nomination. “Don’t ask me any other questions,” Grassley said.


###COMMENT: What's the point of a DOJ that doesn't prosecute the instigator of a very nearly successful coup anyway?

###COMMENT: Matt Gaetz won’t be running the DOJ.  Everything is going to be run from the White House.  These people are figureheads to distract us with shenanigans.  The core people running these agencies will be in the White House and will not be the ones getting Senate confirmation.

###COMMENT: So they're implying that Garland didn't already do that?

###COMMENT: This is what the people wanted

###COMMENT: It's not like the justice department did its job the last 8 years as it is.

###COMMENT: Sucks that

• ⁠15 million Lazy Dems stayed home
• ⁠Asian, Latina and White women voted against Harris.

###COMMENT: And we all thought the first Trump presidency was a crime wave. Just wait…

###COMMENT: That’s the plan

###COMMENT: That's not a problem, that's the intention.

###COMMENT: The law & order party everyone... It's gonna be the biggest clown show in the world.

###COMMENT: I really don’t think he will be confirmed. But it will truly be a disaster if he is confirmed.

###COMMENT: Conservative women, you put a sex trafficker of an underage girl in charge of the DOJ. I hope you are proud of yourselves.

###COMMENT: Hey Matt, where did that kid you “adopted” come from? You seem to be very unclear on that one

###COMMENT: and suddenly everyone working in DOJ must be under 18 years old girls that looks smoking hot

###COMMENT: I believe that's the point.

###COMMENT: I hope he does. You reap what you sow.

###COMMENT: Destroying the agencies seems to be the goal

###COMMENT: No shit. This administration is going to destroy this country forever. Ok, maybe not forever in the literal sense. There’s always a possibility that after humanity is wiped off the planet due to climate change or a new plague thanks to RFKjr, life finds a way to come back and perhaps they also have a country they call the United States of America… in that sense yes it wouldn’t technically be forever. This America though? Oh we’re cooked. This administration will absolutely destroy it.

###COMMENT: So irritating that stories like this get pushed.  Gaetz's appointment is a clusterfuck, and so clearly one.  Why do we need a doom story about it that will lead to folks on the right moaning again about hyperbolic complaints.

Discussing destroying the agency isn't helpful to anyone other than getting clicks for slate on social media.

###COMMENT: The Dumpster has been ordered to destroy America. It is patently obvious to anyone with a head. Every appointment is designed to be a FUCK YOU to the people with any shred of decency left. 

Meanwhile, the whole world watches the oligarchs move into position.

###COMMENT: The media still keeps reporting on this as if it's news.  They are on record saying they want to tear down the federal government.  Make it so small "you could drown it in a bathtub" (Gingrich I think).  And they've been saying it for a long time.  Instead of all the breathless "look what they did now!" that's going to exhaust us, they should be helping us organize.  They're on the chopping block too.

###COMMENT: Thanks merrick garland!

###COMMENT: I kind of hate articles like this because frankly, that’s the plan they want to destroy the Department of Justice. 

The people who read articles like this already know that.

###COMMENT: Laws for thee and not for me...

###COMMENT: Political violence is not the answer.

Also, life as you know it is over
